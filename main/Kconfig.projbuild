                GPIO number (IOxx) to read the bell state from.
                Some GPIOs are used for other purposes (flash connections, etc.) and cannot be used.
                GPIO 0 is also the boot pin on ESP32, so the BOOT button can be used for testing.
                GPIO 9 is used on ESP-C3-32S-Kit as BOOT button.
